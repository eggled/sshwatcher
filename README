Designed for FreeBSD with the ipfw firewall. Every 10 seconds, this looks for any failed ssh logins & blocks the originating IP address.  I always login using an SSH key (and have password authentication disabled), so any failed logins using a password or an invalid username always need to be blocked.

This adds all blocking rules to a single rule number in the firewall, making disabling really easy.  It also stores the rules in my running firewall script so I an restore them at system startup.


Setup required:

Make syslog send all auth.info and authpriv.info entries to /var/log/sshauth.log.  This will be read by sshwatch.bash & used to block IP addresses. The appropriate line looks like:

	auth.info;authpriv.info				/var/log/sshauth.log

Then, run sshwatch.bash as root. (i.e. sudo nohup bash sshwatch.bash &)


In a couple of weeks, this has blocked a total of 625 IP addresses that have appeared to be attempting a brute force attack on my server.  I have rules in the firewall before the blocking rule that allow IPs on my LAN and from my work IP, so those will always be able to login (and won't be accidentally blocked).
